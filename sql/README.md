# MoPCore's Database. (Current Version: N/A)

The databases auth_database.sql and characters_database.sql can still be found inside the sql/base folder.

MoPCore's world_database.sql file has been removed due to "legal reasons". 

For now you can use the world database file found here: [SFDB_548](https://mega.nz/#!lxRTTTqK!rdEBF0d3W_hqR2oLLwFSjWEBm8jW2HvI1v_68PEID0o)

Thanks to ProjectSkyFire for the backup world database, hopefully we can re-release ours soon!
